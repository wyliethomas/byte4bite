Byte 4 Bite is a free and open platform to community pantries of all shapes and sizes. It is designed to allow a community panty to manage and maintain inventory in their pantry in the most easiest and frictionless way possible. 

A pantry coordinate should be able to easily maintain inventory via an admin tool.

Users will get a login where they can create a cart and add items to the cart. Rather than a typical ecomm transaction. When a cart is complete, the pantry operator is able to see what carts need to be fulfilled. They will box the order and set it aside.

The user will go to the pantry and pick up their items.
